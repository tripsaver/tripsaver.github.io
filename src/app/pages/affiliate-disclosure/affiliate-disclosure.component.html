      <h2>1. What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        TripSaver is a travel recommendation engine and deal aggregator. We help you find the best hotels, 
        flights, and travel packages by comparing prices and using AI-driven algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you click on a link to book through our platform, we may earn a commission from our affiliate partners. 
        <strong>This does NOT increase the cost to you</strong> — you pay the same price whether you book directly 
        or through our links.

    <section id="how-commissions-work">
      <h2>3. How Commissions Work</h2>
      
      <h3>3.1 Commission Amount</h3>
      <p>
        When you book through our affiliate links:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ You pay the <strong>exact same price</strong> as if you booked directly</li>
        <li>✅ We receive a commission from the platform (NOT from you)</li>
        <li>✅ This commission is built into their normal affiliate program, not added to your bill</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 What We Use Commissions For</h3>
      <p>Commission income helps us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain and improve our recommendation engine</li>
        <li>Keep the website free to use (no paywalls or ads)</li>
        <li>Research travel trends and optimize recommendations</li>
        <li>Expand to more destinations and travel types</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 No Extra Cost to You</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>This is crucial:</strong> Our commission comes from the platform's marketing budget, not from your booking cost. 
        You will never pay more because you booked through TripSaver.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Our Transparency Commitment</h2>
      
      <h3>4.1 Clear Labeling</h3>
      <p>
        All our affiliate links are clearly labeled with "sponsored" or "affiliate" tags. You'll see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔗 Links marked as "nofollow sponsored"</li>
        <li>ℹ️ Disclaimer text near CTAs</li>
        <li>💡 Tips about comparing platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 No Paid Rankings</h3>
      <p>
        Our recommendations are based on <strong>data and algorithms, not commissions</strong>. 
        We don't rank hotels higher because they pay us more. Our ranking system considers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>📊 Price competitiveness</li>
        <li>⭐ User ratings and reviews</li>
        <li>📍 Seasonality and demand</li>
        <li>🎯 Your preferences and search filters</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Conflict of Interest Management</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain integrity, we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Display commissions we earn (this page)</li>
        <li>Compare across multiple affiliate partners</li>
        <li>Recommend the best option for you, regardless of commission</li>
        <li>Allow you to compare prices side-by-side</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Q: Do you charge me to use TripSaver?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No. TripSaver is completely free. We make money through affiliate commissions only.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: Will I pay more if I book through your links?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No. The commission is paid by the platform to us, not added to your booking cost. 
        You pay the same price whether you book directly or through TripSaver.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: Why should I trust your recommendations if you earn commissions?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Great question. We're transparent about our model because we believe honest disclosure 
        builds trust. Our algorithm is data-driven, not commission-driven. We even recommend booking directly if 
        another platform offers a better price.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: Can I see your actual earnings?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> We don't publicly share individual earnings, but we're transparent about commission rates 
        (see Section 2). We disclose all affiliate relationships.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: What if I want to book directly without affiliates?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! You can use our links to search and compare, then book directly if you prefer. 
        We provide the tools; you control the booking method.
      </p>

      <h3>Q: Do you ever recommend non-affiliate options?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes. For some niche travel types or special cases, we may recommend platforms we're not 
        affiliated with. Our goal is to help you find the best option, period.
